# Basic Example

## Building

First follow the __Building__ instructions in the root __README__, then

```sh
make
```

This will compile the PureScript source files, bundle them, and use Browserify to combine PureScript and NPM sources into a single bundle.

Then open `html/index.html` in your browser.
